**The Last Tempest** is my first game development project. This game is a simple action game. You open the doors by cutting down NPC enemies and collecting items, and then you finish the game by defeating the boss on the door you have opened. The game consists of a single level.

**Important Note:** This project is a beginner-level game and has many shortcomings. Improvements need to be made in areas such as game mechanics, visuals and sounds. 

**They are missing:**
- Lack of sound and music
- Improvements can be made to the graphics
- It is thought that more levels should be added
- Game testing and bug fixes may be required
- Codes must be edited
## Code Optimization and Data Usage

Since it is your first project, no attention has been paid to code optimizations. 


### Controls:
-**Directional Keys / WASD**: Movement
-**E**: Skill
- **Left Mouse Button**: Attack
- **F**: Inventory

### Future Plans:
I plan to make improvements on this project and add more features.
